        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Joshua Gonzales, a student passionate about web development and all other cool things. BeReel is a tool that displays user memories from the app BeReal in a timelapse. I created this site as a passion project after being an active user and wanted to make something special for new years.</p>
        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>All user information is fetched by another open-source project by <a href="https://github.com/chemokita13/beReal-api">chemokita13</a> 
            by using an API to access endpoints from BeReal. It does most of the heavy lifting including user login, authentication, posting, 
            feed information etc. It's an amazing project to look into and the creater is extremely talented so please give him a star.
            After downloading all memories of the user's choosing, BeReel process it all, adding effects, audio, proper timing and
            stores a video in your local computer. Check out the privacy policy page for more information.
        </p>

        <h2>My phone number doesn't work/can't get a verification code?</h2>
        <p>Check if the phone number you entered includes your area code in E.164 format with no dashes, spaces or unrelated characters.
            If you used BeReel repeatedly, please wait for a few minutes to request another verification code. I only tested the app with my
            own phone number so only North American phone numbers are the ones confirmed to be working. If you got errors, add a discussion on the git page and I'll 
            see how I can help. üëç
        </p>

        <h2>Will this have a full web release?</h2>
        <p>Most likely not, sorry. There are a lot of resources involved that requires a lot of planning and infrastructure development to ensure data downloaded is stored
            securely for each and every user. It is better to be used as a local-run application for personal use. I may consider it in the future but as of now it remains an
            open-source passion project
        </p>
